    Respected Sir,
    <br>

    Greetings from the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell of Govt
    Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara!
    <br>

    On behalf of the organising committee of Technopreneur 2023, I am honoured to
    invite you as our distinguished speaker at Technopreneur 2023, the national-level
    entrepreneurial symposium of Govt. Model Engineering College.
    <br>

    Govt. Model Engineering College (MEC) has been a centre of excellence for the last
    32 years and has carved an elegant niche for itself among the best engineering
    colleges across India. We take great pride in introducing you to the 12th edition of Technopreneur, the flagship
    E-summit of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell of our college (IEDC MEC).
    <br>

    Reaching 50,000+ people directly with a national impact, Technopreneur
    2023 will be a national-level e-summit that includes a plethora of events including
    Idea Pitching, Prototype Development, Hackathons, and much more. The legacy of
    our speakers include prominent voices such as Mr. Sam Pitroda (Former Advisor
    to PMO), Dr. K. Radhakrishnan (Former ISRO Chairman), Dr. S. Gopalakrishnan
    (Co-founder of Infosys),<b></b> Mr. Suhas Gopinath </b>(World’s youngest CEO, Globals Inc.)
    among others.
    <br>
    <br>

    This year’s theme for Technopreneur is “Soaring Through Adversity”. We aim to encourage and aid students in becoming
    efficient young entrepreneurs despite the challenges lying ahead. We believe that your valuable life experiences
    would be immensely beneficial to our participants.

    Date of event: 26th March, 2023 (tentative)
    Venue: Le Méridien, Kochi
    Type of Audience: College students, working professionals, startup founders, entrepreneurs and KSUM, TiE, CII
    officials.

    Our participants would be intrigued to learn more about how you came up with the concept of Zerodha, the challenges
    you encountered in the beginning and how you successfully created a user base with very little advertising amidst a
    lot of competition. We’d love to discover how your thought process aligned to this idea and how ‘the Nithin Kammath’
    moulded his vision into a mega success story. Being the person who made Zerodha the top brokerage firm in India,
    we'd love for you to speak on the topic Bootstrapping a Unicorn and Organic Growth. Having a person of your calibre
    and stature speak at our event would be an intense distinction to our summit. It would be a great privilege to have
    you at Technopreneur and to know more about your exciting journey.

    We solicit your gracious presence at Technopreneur 2023 to make it a remarkable summit.
